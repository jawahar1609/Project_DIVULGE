# Project_DIVULGE
## Facial reconstruction Web-app

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, wearing masks in public settings is an effective way to prevent viruses from spreading. Masked face reconstruction is a highly useful in the following areas.
- Crime scene solving
- Face recogonition
- Archaeology

Divulge is build with Pix2Pix is a Generative Adversarial Network, or GAN, model designed for general purpose image-to-image translation.

## What it does ?
* Training data pairs (x and y where x: input image and y: output image)

* Pix2Pix uses the conditional GAN (CGAN) → G: {x, z} → y. (z → noise vector, x → input image, y → output image)

* Generator Network (Encode- decode architecture) as an image is the input, we want to learn the deep representation and decode it and Discriminator Network (PatchGAN).

* CGAN loss function and L1 or L2 Distance.
